I'm taking my first steps in Python. Here's what I need to know on Day 1

1. Overview of Python
    - Python is a high-level programming language that really shines for its simplicity.
    - Emphasizes clean, human-readable syntax — often described as "executable pseudocode."
    - Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python; he released it while working at CWI in 1991.
    - It is an interpreted programming language. This means every line of code gets executed line by line.

2. What's the purpose of learning Python?
    - Simplicity
    - High career opportunities
    - AI/ML (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, etc.)
    - Automation
    - Data Analysis (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
    - Mathematics

3. Real-world jobs to apply for
    - Backend web dev (Django, FastAPI, Flask)
    - Data analyst / Data scientist
    - Machine Learning / AI engineer
    - DevOps & automation engineer
    - Cybersecurity (scripting, pentesting tools)
    - Quantitative trader / algo trading

These are the introductory things I needed to know before starting Python.

Now I have installed it:
    - Downloaded the latest stable version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - Installed with default recommended settings (including "Add Python to PATH")
    - Verified with `python --version` in terminal → works perfectly
            (If `python --version` ever fails → Python is not in PATH; beginner solution: reinstall again)


# Also, I'm using PyCharm as my code editor because it's much more beginner-friendly for me than the other editors out there.
