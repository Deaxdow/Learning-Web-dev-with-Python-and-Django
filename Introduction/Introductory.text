Hello Stranger,
If you're here, you're peeking at the messy first steps of a guy who's just trying to figure this web dev things.
Nothing here is perfect. Half of it probably sucks.

I'm learning in public. No flexing, no faking. Just raw progress.

If something helps you — steal it.
If something's broken — roast me or fix it.
Either way, thanks for stopping by.

Still grinding.
Still a beginner.
Never staying one.
