Today I'm going to learn about Python String Data types in depth , here are the things to know 1st
  Remove the quotes from the examples in main.py to run,debug and understand code line by line.
  Examples are in main_01.py

1.Strings
-> Strings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes, used to represent text data.
    -Single quote string
    -Double quote string
    -Triple single quote string
    -Triple double quote string

2.String Indexing
-> String indexing refers to accessing individual characters in a string by their position
    -Positive Indexing
    -Negative Indexing

3.String Slicing
-> String slicing is the process of extracting a substring from a string using start and end indices.

4.String concatenation
-> String concatenation is combining two or more strings into one using the addition operator.

5.String Method
->String methods are built-in functions that perform operations on strings.
    -String repetition
    -Format using %
    -uppercase
    -lowercase
    -Capitalize
    -Title case

6.String replacement
-> String replacement substitutes a specified substring with another using the replace method.

7.String split into list
-> String splitting divides a string into a list of substrings based on a delimiter like spaces.


8.String tripping
-> removing white space: String stripping removes unwanted whitespace from strings.
    -lstrip : Lstrip removes leading whitespace from the left side of the string.
    -rstrip : Rstrip eliminates trailing whitespace from the right side of the string.
    -strip  : Strip clears whitespace from both the beginning and end of the string.

9.Math or Number Basic Arithmetic calculation with number
-> Basic arithmetic involves performing calculations on numbers.
    - Addition
    - subtraction
    - Multiplication
      etc.

10.Type conversion
-> type conversion changes a value from one data type to another.
   - float -> int
   - int -> float
   - str -> int
   - str -> float
   - float -> str
   - int -> str

11.Python Operator  Precedence
-> Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed in an expression.
     1.multiplication
     2.Division
     3.Modulus %
     4.Addition +
     5.Substraction

12.Python math
-> Python math provides functions for advanced mathematical operations via the math module.
    -Square root
    -Power
    -Trigonometric Functions
    -Logarithmic
    -Factorial
    -Greatest Common divisor
